# onedark-pro-zsh-syntax-highlighter

I looked all over and literally nobody has published this color scheme for [ZSH Syntax highlighting](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting) yet.

I made this using colors picked from the [One Dark Pro](https://github.com/Binaryify/OneDark-Pro) VSCode extension.

To use this, throw it somewhere in your `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME` or something and add this line to your `.zshrc`
```zsh
source "$ZDOTDIR/syntax-highlighter.zsh"
# or wherever you put it
```
