# onedark-pro-zsh-syntax-highlighter

I looked all over and literally nobody has published this color scheme for [ZSH Syntax highlighting](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting) yet.

I made this using mostly colors picked from the [One Dark Pro](https://github.com/Binaryify/OneDark-Pro) VSCode extension, as well as some I modified slightly (for variety ðŸ˜…).

To use this, throw it somewhere in your `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME` or something and add this line to your `.zshrc`
```zsh
source "$ZDOTDIR/one-dark-syntax-highlighter.zsh"
# or wherever you put it
```

Here's an example:

*just to explain the last few lines, paths that won't resolve are not underlined. Also, I have interactive comments turned on*

Like always, I will update it if you open an issue and ask. Pull requests are most certainly welcomed here.
